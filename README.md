# TodoListApp
#### By: Alek Kaluza

### Version 1
Version 1 of the TodoListApp includes all of the following funcationality:
1. Account Creation
2. Login
3. Creating Todos
4. Marking Todos as Complete
5. Deleting Todos
6. Viewing Profile Info
7. Logging Out
This was all committed in one push as I had trouble connecting my GitHub to XCode at first. Further version history will be included.

##### Version 1.1
Version 1.1 now includes today's date on the top of the Todo List view in the toolbar. This was added so users could easily remember the date without having to exit the app. My friend Shantanu added this functionality through a new branch, which was then merged into the main branch.

### How to Setup
Here are the steps one must take to download this application:
1. Have XCode installed for Mac and iOS Development (Available on Mac only)
2. Clone the repository to your device wherever youâ€™d like
3. Open the project in XCode by selecting the GitHub Folder
4. All packages and dependencies should be included so give it a little while to load
5. Build the application by selecting the play button in the top left above the files
6. You should have a fully functional app on the simulator! Here you can create a new account, log in, and create your todos
